    * The ‘create’ command now has a ‘-m TEXT’ option to define the content
      of the newly created fragment.
    * The ‘build’ command now has a ‘--keep’ option to keep fragments in
      place.
    * Support having the release notes for each version in a separate file.
    * Support fragments not associated with any issue.
    * Default branch for `towncrier check` is now "origin/main"

  * Update URLs for upstream metadata.
